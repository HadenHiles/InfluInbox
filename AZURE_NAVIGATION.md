## Finding Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)

Azure has rebranded Azure Active Directory to **Microsoft Entra ID**. Here's how to find it:

### Method 1: Search (Recommended)
1. In Azure Portal, use the top search bar
2. Search for: `Microsoft Entra ID` or `Entra ID`

### Method 2: All Services Menu
1. Click the hamburger menu (â‰¡) on the left
2. Select **"All services"**
3. Under **"Identity"** section, find **"Microsoft Entra ID"**

### Method 3: Direct URL
Navigate to: `https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview`

### Method 4: Entra Admin Center
Go directly to: [entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com)

## Common Issues

- **"Azure Active Directory" not found**: It's now called "Microsoft Entra ID"
- **Search returns no results**: Try "Entra" instead of the full name
- **Different interface**: Microsoft is gradually migrating to the new Entra experience

## What to Look For

Once you find Microsoft Entra ID, you should see:
- **App registrations** (for OAuth setup)
- **Users**
- **Groups** 
- **Enterprise applications**
- **Authentication methods**

## Alternative Access

If you still can't find it:
1. Check if you have the right permissions
2. Try logging in with a different Microsoft account
3. Contact your organization's admin if using a work account
